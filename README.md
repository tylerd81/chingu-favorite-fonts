# Favorite Fonts

## Features

This application was created for the Chingu Voyage 13 Prework Assignment.

It allows you to view and search for Google fonts. You can type some text and
see how the font will look. You can also change the size of the fonts.

It was created with create-react-app. The application uses the Google font API to query for
the most popular fonts. 

The application tries to only load fonts as you need them. If the Google API returns 900
different font results the application will only download the fonts that are needed. You can
load more fonts by clicking the "Load More" button at the bottom.
