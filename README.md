# Favorite Fonts

This application was created for the Chingu Voyage 13 Prework Assignment.

It allows you to view and search for Google fonts. You can type some text and
see how the font will look. You can also change the size of the fonts.

It was created with create-react-app. It uses the Google font API to query for
the most popular fonts.
